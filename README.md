## Hey there ðŸ˜€!

**Saurav** here, and I'm currently a *Frontend Engineer at ZKX*.

I love new things, and doing new stuff, as long as It makes me spin my Processor.ðŸ˜‚

I'm looking for some open source projects to contribute to:
My skillset includes but is not limited to:

1. Vanilla JS
2. ReactJS ðŸ¥°
3. NodeJS
4. GoLang ðŸ¤¯
5. TypeScript ðŸ˜ˆ
6. Rust
7. SVM
8. EVM
9. NestJS
10. PostgreSQL

I also tried to maintain [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)

Have a look around... I won't bother you.

Let's Go... ðŸš€
