## Hey there ðŸ˜€!

I'm **Saurav**, and I'm currently an *UG at IITK doing my bachelor's* in Electrical Eng.

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** ðŸ¥³, aiming to become **Full Stack Web Dev** some day... ðŸ¤©

I love new things, and doing new stuff, as long as It makes me spin my Processor.ðŸ˜‚

I'm looking for some open source projects to contribute to:
My skillset includes but is not limited to:

1. Vanilla JS
2. ReactJS ðŸ¥°
3. NodeJS
4. GoLang ðŸ¤¯
5. TypeScript ðŸ˜ˆ

I also tried to maintain [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)

Have a look around... I won't bother you.

Let's Go... ðŸš€
