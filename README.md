## Hey there 😀!

**Saurav** here, and I'm currently a *Frontend Engineer at Quicksell*.

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** now, aiming to become **Full Stack Web Dev** some day... 🤩

I love new things, and doing new stuff, as long as It makes me spin my Processor.😂

I'm looking for some open source projects to contribute to:
My skillset includes but is not limited to:

1. Vanilla JS
2. ReactJS 🥰
3. NodeJS
4. GoLang 🤯
5. TypeScript 😈

I also tried to maintain [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor)

Have a look around... I won't bother you.

Let's Go... 🚀
